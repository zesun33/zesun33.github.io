## Astromorphic Transformers: Bio-Inspired Neural Architecture

This research project explores the development of astromorphic transformers, a novel neural network architecture inspired by astronomical observations and cosmic phenomena. The work investigates deep connections between transformer attention mechanisms and stellar formation patterns.

### Research Objectives

- **Bio-inspired Design**: Develop transformer architectures based on natural astronomical processes
- **Efficiency Enhancement**: Improve computational efficiency for long-context sequence processing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Leverage cosmic formation patterns for attention mechanism optimization

### Key Contributions

ðŸ”¬ **Novel Architecture**: Introduction of astromorphic attention mechanisms that mimic stellar formation dynamics

âš¡ **Enhanced Performance**: Significant improvements in processing efficiency for long sequences

ðŸŒŸ **Theoretical Framework**: Development of mathematical models connecting astronomical phenomena to neural attention

### Technical Approach

The project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques combined with insights from astrophysics to create more efficient transformer models. Our approach focuses on:

1. **Attention Mechanism Design**: Inspired by gravitational interactions in stellar systems
2. **Sequence Processing**: Optimized for long-context applications
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Reduced memory and processing requirements

### Publications

This work has been accepted for publication in **IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems** (2025), marking a significant milestone in bio-inspired neural architecture research.

### Collaborations

**Research Team**: 
- Md Zesun Ahmed Mia (Lead Researcher)
- Malyaban Bal 
- Abhronil Sengupta

**Institution**: Pennsylvania State University

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
