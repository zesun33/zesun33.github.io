Welcome to my academic website! I am Md Zesun Ahmed Mia, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, working under the supervision of Dr. Abhronil Sengupta. I am also currently a Graduate Technical Intern at Intel Corporation, where I work on thin film process and device integration for advanced memory and logic applications.

My research focuses on **neuromorphic computing**, **machine learning hardware**, and **emerging semiconductor devices**. I am particularly interested in brain-inspired hardware architectures, spiking neural networks (SNNs), and algorithm-device co-design. My work spans across multiple domains including spintronics, ferroelectric devices, in-memory computing, and edge AI systems.

Currently, I am developing ML and neuromorphic hardware solutions for edge AI applications, with a focus on device-circuit co-design using spintronic and ferroelectric devices. My research aims to bridge the gap between emerging device physics and practical AI hardware implementations.

## Current Research Areas:

- **Neuromorphic Computing**: Brain-inspired hardware and spiking neural networks
- **Machine Learning Hardware**: ML accelerators and in-memory computing
- **Emerging Devices**: Spintronics, FeFET, and non-volatile memory devices
- **Semiconductor Process Integration**: Device fabrication and process optimization
- **AI for Semiconductor**: ML for device/process optimization and yield prediction

## Background:

I completed my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Penn State (2019-2021) with a thesis on "Neuromorphic Computing for Lifelong Learning," and my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) in 2019.

You can find my research publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j-zfUj8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zesun-ahmed/) for professional networking. I'm also active on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md-Zesun-Ahmed-Mia-2/) where I share my research and engage with fellow researchers.

Feel free to explore my publications, ongoing projects, and recent news. I welcome opportunities for collaboration and discussion about research in neuromorphic computing, ML hardware, and emerging semiconductor technologies.
