  abstract={Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes—cells that constitute more than 50% of human brain cells—in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The crosslayer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuronastrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuronastrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks (IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse machine learning tasks.},

  abstract={Neuromorphic computing aims to achieve superior efficiency by simulating the human brain to surpass traditional computers. It is crucial for neuromorphic devices to possess excellent biological characteristics, offering a vital way to address existing technical bottlenecks in artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we demonstrate adaptive self-sensitization based on a hydrogen gradient in artificial neurons, empowering neural networks to effectively tackle long-standing challenges of model failure in unknown situations beyond pre-defined boundaries. This advancement propels the design of adaptive neuromorphic devices to process unforeseeable signals autonomously. It significantly promotes the development of AI capable of interacting with complex environments, enhancing capabilities to perform tasks such as autonomous navigation, disaster rescue, and outer space exploration and opening up new possibilities for self-guided cognitive systems.},

  abstract={Astrocytes, an essential component of the brain's neural circuitry, demonstrate learning capabilities through bioplausible mechanisms such as presynaptic plasticity and hebbian plasticity. However, their integration into computational models remains underexplored. This paper advances astromorphic computing techniques to emulate transformer self-attention mechanisms, leveraging astrocytic nonlinearity and memory retention to improve long-range dependency processing in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Existing transformer models have difficulty handling lengthy contexts with thousands of tokens, even with substantial computational resources. We propose Recurrent Memory Augmented Astromorphic Transformers (RMAAT), integrating astrocytic memory and recurrent processing into self-attention, enabling longer context handling without quadratic complexity growth. Our bioplausible model has been found to outperform traditional transformers in experimental tests conducted on the Long Range Arena benchmark and IMDB dataset. Specifically, our model achieves a significant reduction in memory utilization and computational latency. This paves the way for biologically inspired AI models by illustrating how astrocytic characteristics may enhance the performance and efficiency of computational models.},

  abstract={Monolayer gallium nitride (GaN), with its graphenelike honeycomb structure, has emerged as a promising material for nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications. In this study, Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (EMD) simulations using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential were employed to investigate the impact of doping as well as defects on the thermal conductivity of monolayer zigzag GaN nanoribbon (GaN-NR). The thermal transport in aluminum (Al) and indium (In) doped GaN-NR is explored, considering the substitution of both Ga and nitrogen (N) atoms by the dopants. Ga replacement with In led to an increase in thermal conductivity from 11.51 W/m−K to 15.12 W/m−K at a 1% doping concentration. However, in all other cases, whether replacing Ga or N with Al or replacing N with In, it shows an opposite trend, i.e., the thermal conductivity decreases. Furthermore, defects lead to a substantial reduction in thermal conductivity, with a decrease ranging from 68.9% to 77.4% observed at a 2% vacancy concentration across various defect shapes, from point vacancies to hexagon vacancies. We further examine the effect of defect concentrations and defect types on its thermal transport. The results provide valuable insights into the tunability of thermal conductivity in GaN nanostructures, illuminating future optimization for applications in optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.},

  abstract={Semiconductor devices using high k dielectric materials are widely adopted in memory and amplifier applications. Among the semiconductor devices gate all around-FET (GAAFET) is now the latest trend being used instead of other field effect transistors to serve the purpose of reducing the short channel effects (SCE). In this work, we examine the performance of a circular cross-section gate all around-field effect transistor (GAA-FET) with varying gate dielectric characteristics with high-k dielectric oxide materials (Al2O3, HfO2, HfSiO4, SiO2, Ta2O5, TiO2) across the 3-nm channel length. These simulations showed that even though the dielectric constant over the channel increases in value, both ION-IOFF ratio and transconductance upsurge. The obtained results indicated that raising the dielectric constant in a gate oxide reduces subthreshold slope (SS), increases amplification rate, and reduces threshold voltage (VTH) roll-off as well. The Silvaco TCAD ATLAS simulation was calibrated against experimental data from different works of literature. The higher the dielectric constant, the lower the SCEs. It is also found that TiO2 is dominating over the other materials selected for the simulation for a higher value of dielectric constant.},

  abstract={Everything we know is based on our brain's ability to process sensory data. Hearing is a crucial sense for our ability to learn. Sound is essential for a wide range of activities such as exchanging information, interacting with others, and so on. To convert the sound electrically, the role of the audio signal comes into play. Because of the countless essential applications, audio signal & their classification poses an important value. However, in this day and age, classifying audio signals remains a difficult task. To classify audio signals more accurately and effectively, we have proposed a new model. In this study, we've applied a brand-new method for audio classification that combines the strengths of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models with a unique combination of feature engineering to get the best possible outcome. Here, we have integrated data augmentation and feature extraction together before fitting it into the model to evaluate the performance. There is a higher degree of accuracy observed after the experiment. To validate the efficacy of our model, a comparative analysis has been made with the latest conducted reference works.},

  pdf={IRFD - A Feature Engineering based Ensemble Classification for Detecting Electrical Fraud in Traditional Meters.pdf},
  abstract={Nations have suffered significant economic losses as a result of non-technical electric losses resulting from power fraud. It is a criminal act of stealing electricity by applying various mechanisms that incorporate unauthorized tapping to the power line, bypassing the smart meter, etc. Electricity theft is a significant concern for not only developing countries but also developed countries as well. However, for most developing countries, the implications are catastrophic, given that their usage is always less than their demands. Electricity theft must be detected precisely and quickly in order to be mitigated. In our study, we have proposed a method of predictive ensemble machine learning techniques (IRFD) with a novel combination of feature distinction methods to detect electricity theft. In our proposed model, we have combined feature selection technique, Recursive Feature Elimination with Stratified 10-Fold cross-validation (RFECV) and Isolation Forest (IF), to identify and remove outliers along with several machine learning classifiers to forecast the theft of electricity. This study additionally enhances the management of highly imbalanced fraudulent data with Borderline-SMOTE with SVM (SVMSMOTE) and feature scaling with StandardScaler. Following the study, the Random Forest classifier observed a higher degree of accuracy (97.06%) with higher precision, recall, and F1-Score. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed model, comparative analysis of the classification metrics is also assessed with several machine learning classifiers like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, KNN, ANN, along with Random Forest before and after fitting our proposed feature engineering techniques.},
