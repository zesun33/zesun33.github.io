We introduce novel attention mechanisms that mimic stellar formation dynamics and gravitational interactions to improve long-range dependency modeling in transformers. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and representational capacity across multiple cognitive and developmental tasks. Experimental results show enhanced performance in sequence modeling, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning scenarios, with reduced computational overhead compared to traditional transformer architectures.

  abstract={We report a novel self-sensitizable neuromorphic device that employs adaptive hydrogen gradients to achieve brain-like synaptic plasticity and learning functionality. The device architecture exploits controlled hydrogen migration and redistribution within nanostructured materials to modulate synaptic weights dynamically. Through systematic characterization, we demonstrate that the hydrogen gradient mechanism enables both short-term and long-term plasticity, essential for neuromorphic computing applications. The device exhibits remarkable endurance, low power consumption, and excellent retention characteristics. Our approach provides insights into the role of ionic species in artificial synaptic devices and opens new pathways for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware with enhanced learning capabilities and biological fidelity.},

  abstract={RMAAT presents a novel bio-inspired approach to address the computational challenges of processing long-context sequences in transformer architectures. Drawing inspiration from biological neural attention mechanisms and memory consolidation processes, we introduce a recursive memory-attention architecture that dynamically allocates computational resources based on sequence relevance and temporal importance. The proposed method employs adaptive attention pruning, hierarchical memory structures, and biologically-motivated forgetting mechanisms to achieve linear complexity scaling with sequence length. Extensive experiments on long-document understanding, video analysis, and temporal sequence modeling demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and performance accuracy. RMAAT reduces memory requirements by up to 80% while maintaining or improving task performance, enabling practical deployment of transformers on resource-constrained environments for long-context applications.},

  abstract={This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of doping concentrations and structural defects on thermal transport properties of monolayer gallium nitride (GaN) nanoribbons. Using the Green-Kubo method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics techniques, we systematically analyze thermal conductivity variations as functions of dopant type, concentration, and defect density. Results reveal that silicon doping significantly reduces thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering mechanisms, while vacancy defects create localized thermal resistance hotspots. The study identifies optimal doping concentrations for thermal management applications in nanoelectronic devices. Phonon dispersion analysis reveals frequency-dependent scattering mechanisms responsible for observed thermal transport phenomena. These findings provide critical insights for designing GaN-based nanodevices with tailored thermal properties for applications in high-frequency electronics and thermal management systems.},
