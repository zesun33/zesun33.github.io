# Template Blog Post

You can use headers to organize your content.

### Subheaders work too

#### And even smaller headers

## Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Inline `code` is also supported.

## Math

You can include math using LaTeX syntax:

$$E = mc^2$$

Or inline math: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Links

You can include images in your posts. Place images in `assets/img/` and reference them:

<!-- {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/your-image.jpg" title="image title" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} -->
