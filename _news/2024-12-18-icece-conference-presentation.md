ðŸ“š Successfully presented our research on **"Impact of Doping and Defects on Thermal Transport of Monolayer GaN Nanoribbons"** at the 13th International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (ICECE) 2024.

The presentation covered our molecular dynamics simulation study investigating how doping and defects affect thermal transport properties in monolayer GaN nanoribbons, providing valuable insights for nanoelectronic device design.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key highlights:**

- Novel molecular dynamics approach for GaN nanoribbons
- Comprehensive analysis of thermal transport properties
- Implications for next-generation nanoelectronic devices

Looking forward to continued collaboration and advancing this research further!
