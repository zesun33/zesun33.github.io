üìù Submitted our latest research paper **"RMAAT: A Bio-Inspired Approach for Efficient Long-Context Sequence Processing in Transformers"** for peer review.

This work introduces a novel bio-inspired approach to improve transformer efficiency in processing long sequences, drawing inspiration from neural attention mechanisms in biological systems.

üî¨ **Key innovations:**
- Bio-inspired attention mechanisms for enhanced efficiency
- Novel approach to long-context sequence processing  
- Significant improvements in computational performance
- Integration of biological principles with artificial neural networks

The paper represents a significant step forward in making transformer models more efficient and biologically plausible, with potential applications in natural language processing and other sequence modeling tasks.

**Collaboration**: Joint work with Malyaban Bal and Abhronil Sengupta at Pennsylvania State University.
